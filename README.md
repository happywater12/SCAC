SCAC Mobility Data Sample Files

Sample files of SCAC mobility data are uploaded in the repository.

The files are in the format of samplei_j.mat, where:

i: Data number (i-th mobility data)

j: j-th data of the i-th mobility data


Each .mat file contains the x and y coordinates of pedestrians. Each file includes data for 200 pedestrians. There are a total of 50 j files, meaning that to complete the i-th mobility data, you need to gather all 50 j files. Thus, one complete dataset consists of data for a total of 10,000 pedestrians. The order of j does not matter.

For any additional inquiries or to request the complete dataset, please contact huolangheesoo@korea.ac.kr.
